## Introduction

Brief introduction that:

- Hooks the reader with an interesting problem or observation
- States the purpose of your analysis/tutorial
- Outlines what readers will learn or gain

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Takeaway

Highlight the main insight readers will gain from this post.
:::

## Required Packages and Setup

```{r}
#| label: package-demo
#| code-fold: false

# List the packages readers will need
library(tidyverse)
# Add other packages
```

Brief explanation of why these packages were chosen and any setup requirements.

## The Problem/Data

```{r}
#| label: data-prep

# Data loading and initial preparation
# Replace with your actual data source
data <- mtcars
glimpse(data)
```

- Describe your data source
- Explain the problem you're addressing
- Share any initial data preparation steps

## Analysis/Tutorial Steps

### Step 1: Initial Data Exploration

```{r}
#| label: exploration
#| fig-cap: "Description of your visualization"

# Your analysis code here
ggplot(data, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl)), alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "#1e3a5f") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between MPG and Horsepower",
    subtitle = "Grouped by number of cylinders",
    x = "Miles Per Gallon",
    y = "Horsepower",
    color = "Cylinders"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Explain what you found and why it's interesting.

::: {.column-margin}
Here you can add additional context, references, or notes that might be helpful but aren't essential to the main flow of the post.
:::

### Step 2: Main Analysis

```{r}
#| label: analysis

# Core analysis code
model <- lm(mpg ~ hp + wt + cyl, data = data)
summary(model)
```

Walk through your analysis, explaining:
- Why you chose this approach
- What the code does
- What the results mean

### Step 3: Results and Visualization

```{r}
#| label: visualization
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-cap: "Visualization of your results with clear interpretation"

# Create compelling visualizations
library(broom)
augmented_data <- augment(model)

ggplot(augmented_data, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Residual Plot",
    x = "Fitted Values",
    y = "Residuals"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Interpret your results and explain their significance.
