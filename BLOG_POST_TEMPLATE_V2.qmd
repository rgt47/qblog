## Correlation Analysis

```{r}
# Calculate correlations
correlations <- cor(mtcars) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column("var1") %>%
  pivot_longer(-var1, names_to = "var2", values_to = "correlation") %>%

# Section 3: Statistical Modeling

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: CORE ANALYSIS SECTION
This is where you deliver on your promise

-->

Now let's build a statistical model to understand these relationships:

![Penguins deep in analysis mode](../../images/posts/penguin-gentoo-penguin-7073394_1280.jpg){.img-fluid width="45%"}
*"Building our statistical model..."*

## Simple Linear Regression

```{r}
# Fit simple linear model
simple_model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

# Extract model information with confidence intervals
model_summary <- tidy(simple_model, conf.int = TRUE)
model_metrics <- glance(simple_model)

# Display results

cat(sprintf("Slope 95%% CI: [%.2f, %.2f]\n",
            model_summary$conf.low[2], model_summary$conf.high[2]))

# Generate predictions
new_data <- tibble(wt = c(2, 3, 4))
predictions <- predict(simple_model, newdata = new_data, interval = "confidence")

cat("\n📝 Example Predictions (95% CI):\n")
for(i in 1:nrow(new_data)) {
  cat(sprintf("• %.1f thousand lbs: %.1f MPG [%.1f, %.1f]\n",
              new_data$wt[i],

              predictions[i, "lwr"],
              predictions[i, "upr"]))
}
```

## Model Visualization

```{r}
# Visualize model fit with confidence bands
model_plot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl)), size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +

```

# Section 4: Model Diagnostics and Validation

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: GOTCHAS AND PITFALLS
This is critical for technical credibility!
- Highlight common mistakes
- Show what can go wrong
- Provide solutions or workarounds
- Be honest about limitations
-->

![Careful penguins checking their work](../../images/posts/penguins-7553626_1280.jpg){.img-fluid width="40%"}
*"Always validate your assumptions!"*

## Checking Model Assumptions

Before trusting our results, we need to validate key assumptions:

```{r}
# Add diagnostic information
mtcars_diagnostics <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(
    predicted = predict(simple_model),
    residuals = residuals(simple_model),
    standardized_residuals = rstandard(simple_model)
  )

# Check for outliers
outliers <- which(abs(mtcars_diagnostics$standardized_residuals) > 2.5)

cat("⚠️  Model Diagnostic Checks:\n")
cat("============================\n")
cat(sprintf("• Potential outliers: %d observations (>2.5 SD)\n", length(outliers)))
cat(sprintf("• Residual standard error: %.2f MPG\n", sigma(simple_model)))

# Create diagnostic plots
diag_plot <- ggplot(mtcars_diagnostics, aes(x = predicted, y = standardized_residuals)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl)), size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(-2, 0, 2),
             linetype = c("dashed", "solid", "dashed"),
             color = c("red", "black", "red")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = custom_colors, name = "Cylinders") +
  labs(title = "Residual Diagnostic Plot",
       subtitle = "Checking for patterns in model errors",
       x = "Predicted MPG", y = "Standardized Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()

print(diag_plot)
ggsave("diagnostics-plot.png", plot = diag_plot, width = 8, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```

## Common Pitfalls and Gotchas

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: GOTCHAS SECTION
Share hard-won wisdom! This is what separates good tutorials from great ones.
-->

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Assuming Linearity**: Always visualize your data first! Non-linear relationships need different approaches.

2. **Ignoring Outliers**: A few extreme values can drastically affect your results. Investigate them carefully.

3. **Extrapolation Dangers**: Don't make predictions far outside your observed data range.

4. **Correlation ≠ Causation**: Strong correlations don't prove causal relationships.

5. **Sample Size Matters**: Small datasets require extra caution with interpretation.
:::

# Results and Key Findings

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: RESULTS SECTION
Summarize what you've discovered/demonstrated
- Highlight key insights (use numbers!)
- Connect back to objectives from intro
- Make findings actionable
- Provide clear takeaways
-->

![Final results visualization](../../images/posts/penguins-cinema-4d-4030946_1280.jpg){.img-fluid width="50%"}
*"Presenting our findings!"*

Our analysis revealed several important findings:

1. **Strong Weight-MPG Relationship**: Vehicle weight explains 75% of variance in fuel efficiency (R² = 0.75), with each additional 1,000 lbs reducing MPG by ~5.3 miles (95% CI: [-6.5, -4.1])

2. **Cylinder Count Effects**: Cars with fewer cylinders tend to be lighter and more fuel-efficient, suggesting cylinder count is partially mediated through weight

3. **Model Performance**: The simple linear model provides reasonable predictions (RMSE = 3.05 MPG) but shows some systematic patterns in residuals, suggesting room for improvement

4. **Practical Implications**: Weight is a strong, reliable predictor for quick fuel efficiency estimates

# Limitations and Considerations

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: LIMITATIONS SECTION
Academic honesty builds trust! Always discuss:
- Assumptions made and their validity
- Data limitations
- Methodological constraints
- Scenarios where your approach might fail
- Alternative approaches
-->

While this approach is effective, there are important considerations:

## Model Assumptions

- **Linearity**: The weight-MPG relationship appears reasonably linear in the observed range, but may not extend to extreme values
- **Independence**: Observations are assumed independent, though vehicle models may share design characteristics
- **Homoscedasticity**: Residual variance appears relatively constant, though slight heteroscedasticity is visible

## Data Limitations

- **Sample Size**: Only 32 observations limits our ability to detect subtle effects
- **Temporal Scope**: Data from 1974 model year; relationships may differ for modern vehicles
- **Vehicle Types**: Limited to passenger cars; findings may not generalize to trucks, SUVs, or electric vehicles
- **Missing Variables**: Many factors affecting fuel efficiency (aerodynamics, transmission type, engine technology) are not captured

## Method Limitations

- **Simple Model**: Single-predictor model ignores important confounding variables
- **Outlier Sensitivity**: Linear regression can be heavily influenced by extreme values
- **Prediction Range**: Extrapolating beyond observed weight range (1.5-5.5 thousand lbs) is risky

# Practical Applications and Implications

<!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION: APPLICATIONS (Optional but valuable)

-->

In this post, we've demonstrated a complete workflow for exploratory data analysis and simple linear regression. We've seen how vehicle weight strongly predicts fuel efficiency (R² = 0.75), learned to validate model assumptions through diagnostics, and discussed important limitations.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Always start with data exploration before modeling
- Visualize relationships to understand patterns
- Validate assumptions through diagnostic plots
- Be honest about limitations and scope
- Connect statistical findings to practical applications

**Next Steps:**
- Try this workflow with your own dataset
- Experiment with multiple predictor variables
