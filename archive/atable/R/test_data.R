#' A data.frame intended for testing the atable function with random data and missing values in various classes.
#'
#'
#' @format A data frame with 129 rows and 11 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{Split1}{A factor with 2 levels, drawn uniformly.}
#'   \item{Split2}{A factor with 3 levels, drawn uniformly.}
#'   \item{Group}{A factor with 2 levels, drawn uniformly.}
#'   \item{Group2}{A factor with 3 levels, drawn uniformly.}
#'   \item{Numeric}{A sample from the standard normal distribution.}
#'   \item{Numeric2}{A sample from the normal distribution with mean 4 and sd 3.}
#'   \item{Logical}{A Logical, drawn uniformly from \code{TRUE}, \code{FALSE} and \code{NA}.}
#'   \item{Factor}{A factor with 4 level drawn with weigths \code{1:1:2:2}.}
#'   \item{Ordered}{Class Ordered with 3 levels, drawn uniformly.}
#'   \item{Character}{Class character drawn uniformly from \code{c('a', 'b', '')}.}
#'   \item{Date}{Class Date, generated by adding \code{2001-05-25} to
#'   a sample of the Poisson distribution with lambda \code{42}.}

#' 6 Missing values were randomly added to each of Numeric, Numeric2, Factor, Ordered, Character and Date.
