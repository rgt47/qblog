    "text": "7 Workarounds and Design Patterns\n\n7.1 Pattern 1: Accept the Limitation\nDesign your API to require wrapping, not piping:\n\n# Document that this is the correct usage\nzzplot(boxplot(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars))\n\n# Not this\nboxplot(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars) |&gt; zzplot()\n\nThis is explicit and unambiguous. The tradeoff is that it breaks the “pipe everything” mental model some users have developed.\n\n\n7.2 Pattern 2: Provide Both APIs\nOffer a standard evaluation version alongside the NSE version:\n\n# NSE version - for interactive use\nzzplot(plot(x, y))\n\n# SE version - for programmatic use and piping (sort of)\nzzplot_expr(quote(plot(x, y)))\n\n# Or with a string\nzzplot_code(\"plot(x, y)\")\n\n\n\n7.3 Pattern 3: Use Quosures (Tidy Eval)\nThe rlang package provides quosures, which bundle an expression with its environment (Henry and Wickham 2023). This enables more robust expression capture in some contexts:\n\nlibrary(rlang)\n\nmy_function &lt;- function(expr) {\n  quo &lt;- enquo(expr)\n  expr_text &lt;- quo_text(quo)\n  # ... use the quosure\n}\n\nHowever, this still does not solve the pipe problem—enquo() captures what it receives, and the pipe has already evaluated the left-hand side.\n\n\n7.4 Pattern 4: Redesign to Avoid NSE\nSometimes the cleanest solution is to not use NSE at all:\n\n# Instead of capturing expressions, accept functions\nzzplot_fn &lt;- function(plot_fn, ...) {\n  png(\"plot.png\")\n  plot_fn(...)\n  dev.off()\n}\n\n# Usage (pipeable with anonymous functions)\n\\() plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg) |&gt; zzplot_fn()\n\nThis is less elegant but completely unambiguous about evaluation order."

Pipes assume referential transparency because they pre-compute values.\nHadley Wickham notes in Advanced R: “The biggest downside of NSE is that functions that use it are no longer referentially transparent” (Wickham 2019)."

This is not a bug in R or the pipe operators; it is a fundamental tension between:\n\nEager evaluation (pipes compute left-to-right)\nLazy evaluation (functions receive unevaluated promises)\nNon-standard evaluation (functions inspect the expression, not just the value)\n\nWhen writing functions that use substitute(), match.call(), or similar metaprogramming tools, document clearly that piping will not work as expected. When using such functions, remember that wrapping f(g(x)) and piping x |&gt; g() |&gt; f() are semantically different operations, even when they produce the same final value.\nUnderstanding this distinction is essential for effective R metaprogramming and explains why some tidyverse patterns require specific syntax that cannot be arbitrarily reformatted."

    "section": "4 Step-by-Step Implementation",
    "text": "4 Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n4.1 Deployment Checklist\nAs an overview, to host our Shiny app securely online, we need to:\n\nObtain a static IP address\nRegister a domain name\nConfigure a firewall\nSet up the virtual server\nInstall and configure a web server\nImplement SSL encryption\nSet up user authentication\nConfigure reverse proxy routing\n\nWhile this might seem complex, we’ll break it down into manageable steps.\nDetailed instructions for setting up a virtual server (items 1 through 4 above) on EC2 both through the EC2 console and the command line interface can be found: here and here\n\n\n4.2 Step 1: Server Setup\nFirst, we’ll prepare our AWS EC2 environment: In the course of setting up your server, you’ll need to: 1. Create or access your AWS account 2. Generate SSH key-pair, named for example, power1_app.pem 3. Configure firewall settings, allowing SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80) traffic and HTTPS (port 443) traffic. 4. Obtain static IP, e.g., 13.57.139.31 5. Register domain name, e.g. rgtlab.org 6. Launch Ubuntu instance (t2-micro is sufficient)\n\n\n4.3 Step 2: Installing Required Software\nconnect to your server via SSH:\nssh -i \"~/.ssh/power1_app.pem\"  ubuntu@rgtlab.org\nOn your server, install Docker and Caddy (a modern web server with automatic HTTPS) using the following commands.\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install docker.io -y\nsudo apt install -y curl debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https\ncurl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | \\\nsudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg\ncurl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | \\\nsudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install caddy -y\n\n\n4.4 Step 3: Containerizing the Application\nCreate a Dockerfile in your app directory:\n\nDockerfile Configuration\nFROM rocker/shiny:4.2.0\nRUN rm -rf /srv/shiny-server\nCOPY /power1_shiny/* /srv/shiny-server/\nUSER shiny\nCMD [\"/usr/bin/shiny-server\"]\n\n\n\n4.5 Step 4: Configuring the Web Server\nCreate a Caddyfile:\n\nCaddy Server Configuration\nrgtlab.org {\n    basicauth * /power1_shiny/* {\n        bob $2a$14$pYWd5O7JqNeGLS4m4CKkzemM2pq5ezn9bcTDowofZTl5wRVl8NTJm\n    }\n    root * /var/www/html\n    handle_path /power1_shiny/* {\n            reverse_proxy 0.0.0.0:3838\n    }\n    file_server\n}\n\nCreate an index.html:\n\nLanding Page HTML\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Power1 app&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"./power1_shiny/\"&gt;Power1 app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n4.6 Step 5: Deployment\n\nCopy files to server:\n\nscp -r ~/prj/power1_app/ ubuntu@rgtlab.org:~\n\nBuild and run Docker container:\n\ndocker build -t power1_image .\ndocker run -d --name=power1_shiny -p 3838:3838 --restart=always power1_image\n\nConfigure Caddy:\n\nsudo cp ./Caddyfile /etc/caddy/\ncp ./index.html /var/www/html/\nsudo systemctl reload caddy\nYour app should now be available at https://rgtlab.org!"
