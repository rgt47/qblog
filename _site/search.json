    "text": "This is the first in a series of posts offering suggested strategies for leveraging open source technologies to provide straight-forward solutions to one of the central challenges in the practice of data science, i.e. how to effectively communicate analysis results to clients and collaborators. The group of technologies (or stack) we’ll employ is: linux, R, Shiny, Caddy, git, and Docker. We’ll make use of two cloud services github and AWS.\nThis initial post provides a minimal, proof-of-concept example of how to apply these technologies for hosting of an interactive shiny application.\nWe start with a simple, but hopefully useful, stand-alone shiny app and end with a secure (encrypted and authenticated) web site with a custom domain name hosting our app. The approach described here is intentionally minimalist."

    "text": "Select a hosting service\nThere are a number of cloud based server options: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean to name a few. Each has their own approach to setting up a custom virtual server. Several have free or low-cost service tiers available.\nSpecific instructions for AWS EC2 are here in appendix 2.\nOnce the server is available connect via ssh, login, and Install docker, docker-compose and git. with the following command:\nsudo apt install -y git docker docker-compose\nOnce the hosting process is complete we’ll have a customized virtual server wtih a static IP address and unique domain name and firewall in place. In other words, items 1, 2, and 3 will be taken care of."
