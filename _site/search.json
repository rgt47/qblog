    "text": "2.1 Hosting\nHow to set up the hosting server? There are many ways to accomplish the hosting. Here we’ll describe a straightforward and efficient approach using mainstream cloud services and open source tools. In other words, we’ll describe how to ‘spin’ up a virtual server on Amazon Web Service EC2, and use Docker, R, Shiny, and Caddy to put in place a secure web app to share with our colleagues.\n\n\n\nData flow\n\n\nFigure 2 summarizes the flow of program and configuration files. In order to host power1_app online we’ll need to complete the following tasks:\nHosting List\n\nGenerate a virtual server with a firewall on EC2.\nObtain a static IPv4 address (to identify the server online)\nObtain a custom domain name (a name to associate with the static IP address) from a domain registration provider. E.g rgtlab.org\nInstall and configure a webserver on the virtual server ( a tool to interact with https protocol requests )\nObtain and install a TLS (transport layer security) security certificate (to allow encrypted communication between the server and other machines on the network).\nConfigure user authentication for the web site.\nconfigure a reverse proxy method (to translate https, port 443, requests to Shiny, port 3838, requests).\n\n\n\n“What Is An SSL/TLS Certificate?\nAn SSL/TLS certificate is a digital object that allows systems to verify the identity & subsequently establish an encrypted network connection to another system using the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocol. Certificates are used within a cryptographic system known as a public key infrastructure (PKI). PKI provides a way for one party to establish the identity of another party using certificates if they both trust a third-party - known as a certificate authority. SSL/TLS certificates thus act as digital identity cards to secure network communications, establish the identity of websites over the Internet as well as resources on private networks.”\n reference"

    "text": "2.2 Select a hosting service\nIn this post we’ll describe the process using AWS EC2. Detailed instructions for setting up a server on EC2, both via the console and the command line interface are covered in earlier posts (here) and (here).\nIn brief, the process is as follows: To get started with AWS create an account or sign in to the AWS EC2 dashboard. Once on the dashboard set up an environment in which to host the virtual server.\nThe components of this environment are: a ssh key-pair, a firewall, a static IP, and a domain name.\nWith the hosting environment in place, select an instance (AMI, type and disk size), then generate and launch the server.\nOnce the server is available, connect via ssh, and login.\nThe only software necessary to install at this point is docker (assuming it wasn’t installed in the server setup process). Install docker with the following commands:\nsudo snap install docker.io\n\n\nNote: snap is a package management system pre-installed in Ubuntu servers. Not to be confused with the apt package management system.\nOnce the host is set up and docker is installed, we’ll have accomplished items 1, 2, and 3 from our hosting list above. i.e. a customized virtual server wtih a static IP address, a unique domain name and firewall in place."

Caddy is an open-source tool that has the very useful feature of automating the acquisition and installing of an SSL certificate. (An SSL cert is required by most browsers to use the encrypted communication protocol https.)\nWe use the caddy configuration file to specify three critical things.\n\nthe site domain name.\nthe ‘reverse proxy’ map that redirects requests to port 443 (ssl port) to port 3838 (Shiny port).\nadd login credentials for all users (e.g. bob/vanilla47):\n\nOur barebones Caddyfile looks like this:\n\nShow the Caddyfile code\n# use caddy auth tool to generate a password via the `bcrypt` algorithm.\n# &gt; caddy hash-password --plaintext hiccup\n\nrgtlab.org {\nbasicauth /power1/* {\n    Bob $2a$14$Zkx19XLiW6VYouLHR5NmfOFU0z2GTNmpkT/5qqR7hx4IjWJPDhjvG\n}\n    root * /srv\n    handle_path /power1/* {\n        reverse_proxy power1:3838\n    }\n    file_server\n}\n\nWe can accomplish what we need for items 4, 5, and 7 through the Caddyfile.\nNote:\n\nrgtlab.org is our domain name\nhandle_path maps all https requests to port 3838 where Shiny is listening.\n\nProviding our servers domain name, rgtlab.org is sufficient to initiate an exchange with the letsencrypt service to generate an SSL certificate."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Reproducibility is key to conducting data analysis, yet in practice, achieving it consistently with R workflows can be quite challenging. R projects frequently break when transferred between computers due to mismatched R versions, package dependencies, or inconsistent project organization. This white paper describes an approach to solving this problem by combining three tools: zzrrtools for creating structured research compendia, renv for R package management, and Docker for containerizing the computing environment. Together, these tools ensure that an R workflow runs identically across different computers by providing standardized project structure, identical R packages and versions, consistent R versions, and the same operating system libraries as the original setup."

    "text": "1.1 The Challenge of Reproducibility in R\nR has become a standard tool for data science and statistical analysis across numerous scientific disciplines. However, as R projects grow in complexity, they often develop complex webs of dependencies that can make sharing and reproducing analyses difficult. Some common challenges include:\n\nDifferent R versions across machines\nIncompatible package versions\nMissing system-level dependencies\nOperating system differences (macOS vs. Windows vs. Linux)\nConflicts with other installed packages\nR startup files (.Rprofile, .Renviron, .RData) that can affect code behavior\n\nThese challenges often manifest as the frustrating “it works on my machine” problem, where analysis code runs perfectly for the original author but fails when others attempt to use it. This undermines the scientific and collaborative potential of R-based analyses."

When combined, they provide a framework for end-to-end reproducible R workflows with proper research compendium organization.\nWith this three-level framework established, we can now examine how each tool addresses its specific layer of reproducibility. We begin with zzrrtools, which tackles the foundational challenge of project-level organization and provides the structural framework upon which package and system-level reproducibility can be built."

Most importantly, it ensures that all development occurs within the exact computational environment that will be used for final analysis and publication.\nWhile zzrrtools establishes the organizational foundation for reproducible research, it relies on consistent R package environments to function effectively across different systems. The directory structure and R package framework created by zzrrtools becomes most useful when combined with precise dependency management. This is where renv becomes essential, providing the package-level consistency that complements zzrrtools’ structural approach."

This isolation ensures that updates or changes to packages in one project won’t affect others.\nLockfile for dependencies: When you finish installing or updating packages, renv::snapshot() produces a renv.lock file - a JSON document listing each package and its exact version and source. This lockfile is designed to be committed to version control and shared.\nEnvironment restoration: On a new machine (or when reproducing past results), renv::restore() installs the exact versions of packages specified in the lockfile. This creates an R package environment identical to the one that created the lockfile, provided the same R version is available. The R version is important since critical components of the R system, such as random number generation, and default factor handling policy vary between versions."

    "section": "6.2 Implementation Example",
    "text": "6.2 Implementation Example\n\n6.2.1 Project Maintainer Setup (Joe)\nJoe implements the enterprise-grade two-tier Docker strategy for team collaboration:\nStep 1: Create Team Core Images\n# 1. Set up project and team infrastructure\nmkdir penguins_analysis && cd penguins_analysis\nTEAM_NAME=\"rgt47\"  # Docker Hub account for hosting core images\nPROJECT_NAME=$(basename $(pwd))\n\n# 2. Create custom team core image configuration\ncp ~/bin/zzrrtools-support/templates/Dockerfile.pluspackages ./Dockerfile.teamcore\n\n# Edit Dockerfile.teamcore for Palmer Penguins analysis requirements:\n# - Add specialized R packages (palmerpenguins, tidymodels, plotly)\n# - Include statistical modeling packages (brms, rstanarm)\n# - Set team-specific R configurations and themes\n\n# 3. Build and publish team core images for reproducible science\n# Shell-optimized core (lightweight, fast startup)\ndocker build -f Dockerfile.teamcore --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=rocker/r-ver \\\n             -t ${TEAM_NAME}/${PROJECT_NAME}core-shell:v1.0.0 .\n\n# RStudio-optimized core (includes RStudio Server)\ndocker build -f Dockerfile.teamcore --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=rocker/rstudio \\\n             -t ${TEAM_NAME}/${PROJECT_NAME}core-rstudio:v1.0.0 .\n\n# 4. Push to Docker Hub for public reproducible research\ndocker login  # Login to Docker Hub\ndocker push ${TEAM_NAME}/${PROJECT_NAME}core-shell:v1.0.0\ndocker push ${TEAM_NAME}/${PROJECT_NAME}core-rstudio:v1.0.0\nStep 2: Initialize Research Compendium with Custom Base\n# 5. Initialize zzrrtools project using team core image\nzzrrtools --base-image ${TEAM_NAME}/${PROJECT_NAME}core-shell \\\n          --dotfiles ~/.config/shell\n\n# This automatically:\n# - Creates complete research compendium structure\n# - Builds LOCAL development image (inherits from core + adds dotfiles)\n# - Sets up automated GitHub Actions for team image rebuilds\n# - Configures CI/CD for dependency validation\n# - Local image NOT pushed - contains personal dotfiles\nStep 3: Initialize Repository and Automated Infrastructure\n# 6. Set up private GitHub repository for research code\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"🎉 Initial research project setup with automated team infrastructure\n\n- Complete zzrrtools research compendium\n- Team core images published: ${TEAM_NAME}/${PROJECT_NAME}core:v1.0.0\n- Automated GitHub Actions for team image management\n- Private repository protects unpublished research\n- Hybrid privacy model: private code, public environments\"\n\n# Create private repository on GitHub, then:\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/joe/penguins_analysis.git\ngit push -u origin main\nStep 4: Begin Development in Enhanced Environment\n# 7. Start development immediately in professional environment\nmake docker-zsh  # Enhanced zsh with vim IDE, dotfiles, and development tools\nThis creates: - Two-tier Docker architecture with team core + personal development images - Automated team image management via sophisticated GitHub Actions workflows - Professional development environment with vim IDE, zsh enhancements, and testing integration - Zero-setup team onboarding through pre-built, publicly available core images - Hybrid privacy model protecting research while enabling computational reproducibility\nFor detailed information on renv dependency validation, troubleshooting, and team collaboration workflows, see Appendix G: renv Management and Validation.\nThe validation script ensures package environment consistency by verifying dependencies across code files, DESCRIPTION, and renv.lock, preventing common collaboration issues where team members have mismatched environments.\nStep 4: Create Initial Analysis Paper\nJoe creates an initial analysis examining flipper length vs. bill length relationships in the Palmer Penguins dataset, implementing basic visualization and statistical exploration within the research compendium structure.\nStep 5: Create Tests for Analysis Functions\nJoe implements testing to ensure reproducible research through data validation, error detection, and environment verification. Testing provides collaboration confidence and supports publication standards by validating data integrity, statistical relationships, and pipeline functionality.\nJoe sets up the testing framework and creates basic data validation tests to verify dataset availability, dimensions, and required columns. These tests ensure the analysis environment is correctly configured and catch data-related issues early in the development process.\nFor a complete test suite with data validation, statistical tests, and integration tests, see Appendix B: Test Suite.\nStep 6: Create a .gitignore file\nJoe configures version control to track source code and dependencies while excluding generated outputs and temporary files. The principle: track the “recipe” (code + dependencies), not the “meal” (outputs).\nJoe creates a .gitignore file excluding renv libraries, generated outputs, temporary files, and system artifacts. This keeps the repository lightweight while ensuring collaborators can recreate the complete environment from tracked dependencies.\nStep 7: Create a Dockerfile\nzzrrtools generates a Dockerfile with multiple template options. The standard template uses rocker/r-ver, while the pluspackages template includes common R packages like tidyverse. Both provide:\n\nR version consistency: Matches exact R version specified in renv.lock\nDevelopment environment: Includes zsh, vim, tmux, Node.js for plugin support\nSecurity: Non-root user execution with proper file permissions\nTinyTeX integration: LaTeX support for PDF rendering (pluspackages template)\nPre-installed packages: Common packages like tidyverse, DT, testthat (pluspackages template)\n\nThe generated Dockerfile includes development tools and optimizations:\nARG R_VERSION=latest\nFROM rocker/r-ver:${R_VERSION}\n\n# Install comprehensive development environment\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n    git ssh curl wget vim tmux zsh build-essential \\\n    libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev \\\n    libfontconfig1-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev \\\n    libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev \\\n    man-db pandoc \\\n    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n# Install Node.js for vim plugins\nRUN curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | bash - && \\\n    apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n# Create non-root user with zsh shell\nARG USERNAME=analyst\nRUN useradd --create-home --shell /bin/zsh ${USERNAME}\n\n# Set up R environment with renv\nWORKDIR /home/${USERNAME}/project\nCOPY --chown=${USERNAME}:${USERNAME} renv.lock ./\nUSER ${USERNAME}\nRUN R -e \"install.packages('renv'); renv::restore()\"\n\n# Copy project files and install\nCOPY --chown=${USERNAME}:${USERNAME} . .\nRUN R -e \"devtools::install('.')\"\n\nCMD [\"/bin/zsh\"]\nAlternative: Pre-packaged Template\nFor projects using common packages, the pluspackages template includes TinyTeX and popular R packages:\n# Install TinyTeX for PDF rendering\nRUN R -e \"install.packages('tinytex')\" && \\\n    R -e \"tinytex::install_tinytex()\" && \\\n    /root/.TinyTeX/bin/*/tlmgr path add\n\n# Install common R packages (cached layer)\nRUN R -e \"install.packages(c('renv', 'remotes', 'devtools', \\\n    'testthat', 'naniar', 'DT', 'conflicted', 'ggthemes', \\\n    'datapasta', 'janitor', 'kableExtra', 'tidytuesdayR', \\\n    'tidyverse'), repos = c(CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))\"\n\n# Give user write permissions to R library\nRUN chown -R ${USERNAME}:${USERNAME} /usr/local/lib/R/site-library\nFor production Dockerfiles with development environment configuration (zsh, vim plugins, dotfiles integration), see Appendix F: Docker Configuration Examples.\nR Version Synchronization:\nThe Dockerfile uses a build argument to ensure the R version exactly matches what’s specified in renv.lock. This eliminates potential issues from R version mismatches between the package environment and the underlying R interpreter. The build command extracts the R version from the renv lockfile:\n# Extract R version from renv.lock\nR_VERSION=$(jq -r '.R.Version' renv.lock)\n\n# Build Docker image with extracted R version\ndocker build --build-arg R_VERSION=${R_VERSION} \\\n  -t ghcr.io/joe/penguins_analysis:v1.0 .\nIf the renv.lock file specifies R 4.3.1, the Docker image will use rocker/r-ver:4.3.1. If renv is updated to R 4.4.0, the Docker build will use rocker/r-ver:4.4.0. This maintains consistency between the package environment and system environment.\nStep 8: Container-Based Development\nJoe performs all development work inside the Docker container, ensuring consistent environments and immediate visibility of changes to the host system through volume mounting. The container provides a complete development environment with package management, editing tools, and validation utilities.\nStep 9: Update and Share Environment\nWhen package dependencies change, GitHub Actions automatically rebuilds the Docker image with updated renv.lock specifications and pushes the updated environment to Docker Hub for team access. This ensures collaborators have access to the identical development environment.\nStep 5: Automated Validation and Quality Assurance\nJoe validates the complete automated infrastructure:\n# 1. Validate all dependencies with automated checking\nmake docker-check-renv-fix\n\n# 2. Run comprehensive test suite in enhanced environment\nmake docker-test\n\n# 3. Render paper to verify end-to-end workflow\nmake docker-render\n\n# 4. Verify automated GitHub Actions workflows\n# - Push triggers team image rebuilding\n# - Dependency changes trigger notifications\n# - Multi-platform builds complete successfully\nStep 6: Enable Team Access and Documentation\nJoe configures repository permissions and documents the automated workflow:\n\nRepository Settings → Collaborators → Add team members with “Write” access\nConfigure repository secrets for automated Docker Hub publishing:\n\nDOCKERHUB_USERNAME: Team Docker Hub account\nDOCKERHUB_TOKEN: Docker Hub access token for automated publishing\n\nDocument team onboarding with zzrrtools installation and interface choices\nShare public Docker Hub images for reproducible research access\n\nAt this point, Joe has established an enterprise-grade automated research infrastructure. Team members can join with zero manual setup through the automated system.\n\n\n6.2.2 Team Member Onboarding (Sam)\nWhat Sam Receives from Joe: - Repository URL: https://github.com/joe/penguins_analysis - Public Docker Hub image names for core environments - Team development guidelines and interface choices\nSam’s Streamlined Onboarding Process:\n📝 Developer Checklist for Sam:\n\nInstall zzrrtools framework (one-time setup for all future projects)\nFork and clone project repository\nChoose development interface (shell vs RStudio)\nBuild personal development image with dotfiles\nStart development immediately\n\n# 1.

The approach described in this white paper provides a foundation for achieving reproducibility that meets the standards expected in data science and academic research."

Navigate to GitHub Settings: - Go to GitHub.com and sign in - Click your profile picture (top right) → Settings - In the left sidebar: Developer settings → Personal access tokens\nNote: GitHub now offers two token types: - Fine-grained personal access tokens (recommended for new projects) - Personal access tokens (classic) (for broader compatibility)\n2. Create New Token: - Click “Generate new token” and select the appropriate type - Add a descriptive note (e.g., “Docker Container Registry Access”) - Set expiration (recommended: 90 days for security)\n3. Select Required Scopes (check these boxes): - ✅ repo (Full control of private repositories) - Required for private repos - ✅ write:packages (Upload Docker images to GitHub Container Registry) - Required for project maintainer - ✅ read:packages (Download Docker images from GitHub Container Registry) - Required for all team members - ✅ delete:packages (Delete packages from GitHub Package Registry) - Optional but recommended\nNote: Team members only need read:packages and repo, but the project maintainer needs all container permissions to push Docker images.\nToken Type Recommendation: Use fine-grained personal access tokens for new projects as they provide better security and more precise permissions.\n4. Generate and Copy Token: - Click “Generate token” at the bottom - Important: Copy the token immediately - you won’t see it again - Store it securely (see security practices below)"

    "section": "4 Step-by-Step Implementation",
    "text": "4 Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n4.1 Deployment Checklist\nAs an overview, to host our Shiny app securely online, we need to:\n\nObtain a static IP address\nRegister a domain name\nConfigure a firewall\nSet up the virtual server\nInstall and configure a web server\nImplement SSL encryption\nSet up user authentication\nConfigure reverse proxy routing\n\nWhile this might seem complex, we’ll break it down into manageable steps.\nDetailed instructions for setting up a virtual server (items 1 through 4 above) on EC2 both through the EC2 console and the command line interface can be found: here and here\n\n\n4.2 Step 1: Server Setup\nFirst, we’ll prepare our AWS EC2 environment: In the course of setting up your server, you’ll need to: 1. Create or access your AWS account 2. Generate SSH key-pair, named for example, power1_app.pem 3. Configure firewall settings, allowing SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80) traffic and HTTPS (port 443) traffic. 4. Obtain static IP, e.g., 13.57.139.31 5. Register domain name, e.g. rgtlab.org 6. Launch Ubuntu instance (t2-micro is sufficient)\n\n\n4.3 Step 2: Installing Required Software\nconnect to your server via SSH:\nssh -i \"~/.ssh/power1_app.pem\"  ubuntu@rgtlab.org\nOn your server, install Docker and Caddy (a modern web server with automatic HTTPS) using the following commands.\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install docker.io -y\nsudo apt install -y curl debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https\ncurl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | \\\nsudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg\ncurl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | \\\nsudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install caddy -y\n\n\n4.4 Step 3: Containerizing the Application\nCreate a Dockerfile in your app directory:\n\nDockerfile Configuration\nFROM rocker/shiny:4.2.0\nRUN rm -rf /srv/shiny-server\nCOPY /power1_shiny/* /srv/shiny-server/\nUSER shiny\nCMD [\"/usr/bin/shiny-server\"]\n\n\n\n4.5 Step 4: Configuring the Web Server\nCreate a Caddyfile:\n\nCaddy Server Configuration\nrgtlab.org {\n    basicauth * /power1_shiny/* {\n        bob $2a$14$pYWd5O7JqNeGLS4m4CKkzemM2pq5ezn9bcTDowofZTl5wRVl8NTJm\n    }\n    root * /var/www/html\n    handle_path /power1_shiny/* {\n            reverse_proxy 0.0.0.0:3838\n    }\n    file_server\n}\n\nCreate an index.html:\n\nLanding Page HTML\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Power1 app&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"./power1_shiny/\"&gt;Power1 app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n4.6 Step 5: Deployment\n\nCopy files to server:\n\nscp -r ~/prj/power1_app/ ubuntu@rgtlab.org:~\n\nBuild and run Docker container:\n\ndocker build -t power1_image .\ndocker run -d --name=power1_shiny -p 3838:3838 --restart=always power1_image\n\nConfigure Caddy:\n\nsudo cp ./Caddyfile /etc/caddy/\ncp ./index.html /var/www/html/\nsudo systemctl reload caddy\nYour app should now be available at https://rgtlab.org!"
