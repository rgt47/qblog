Detailed instructions for AWS EC2 are covered in an earlier post here.\n\nCreate an account or sign in.\nSet up an interactive environment with AWS server.\n\ndefine ssh key-pair.\nconfigure firewall.\nrequest static IP.\nobtain domain name.\nselect an instance and launch server.\n\n\nOnce the server is available connect via ssh, and login,\nThe only necessary software to install is docker and git. Install both with the following commands:\nsudo apt install -y git\nsudo snap install docker.io\nOnce the host is set up and the requisite software installed we’ll have a customized virtual server wtih a static IP address, and a unique domain name and firewall in place. In other words, items 1, 2, and 3 from our hosting list above will be taken care of."

    "text": "Website\nTo configure the web server and containerize our app we need to add three files to the repo, to go along with our Shiny app.\nWe’ll use a slightly indirect route to create and place the necessary files on the server but this approach will allow to do all our countinuing development on our local workstation and have the web app be automatically continually undated. We’ll create the configuration files we need on our workstation and push them github and from there they can be accessed from our server.\nThese three configuation files are:\n\na Docker configuration file (default name Dockerfile)\n\n\n\n  Photo by Ian Taylor on Unsplash \nWe’ll use docker to access R/Shiny, and docker-compose to access Caddy, our webserver. The first file is the dockerfile. Here is our minimal dockerfile with comments:\n\nshow the Dockerfile code\nfrom rocker/shiny:4.2.0\ncopy /power1_shiny/* /srv/shiny-server/\ncmd [\"/usr/bin/shiny-server\"]\n\n\nGrab the latest rocker/Shiny image from Docker Hub to use as a base image.\nCopy the Shiny code to the default location for shiny-server\nRun the Shiny-server using the default app code\n\nThis configuration file instructs Docker to build a container based on a Rocker/Shiny image (which itself is a ubuntu image with R and Shiny installed) then copy into the container the power1_shiny.R code and finally launch Shiny on (default) port 3838. We placed the power1_app.R code in the default location /srv/shiny-server we only need to start the server and it will find the shiny program.\n\na Caddy web server configuration file (default name Caddyfile)\n\nWe’ll use Caddy as our web server. Caddy is an open-source tool that has the very useful feature of automating the acquiring and installing of an SSL certificate. An SSL cert is required by most browsers to use the encrypted communication protocol https.\nCaddy is configured with a file named Caddyfile. We use the caddy configuration file to specify three critical things.\n\nthe site domain name.\nthe ‘reverse proxy’ map that redirects requests to port 443 (ssl port) to port 3838 (Shiny port).\nadd login credentials for bob/vanilla47:\n\nOur barebones Caddyfile looks like this:\n\nShow the Caddyfile code\n# use caddy auth tool to generate a password via the `bcrypt` algorithm. \n# &gt; caddy hash-password --plaintext vanilla47 \nrgtlab.org {\n    basicauth * /power1_shiny/* {\n        bob $2a$14$pYWd5O7JqNeGLS4m4CKkzemM2pq5ezn9bcTDowofZTl5wRVl8NTJm\n    }\n    root * /srv\n    handle_path /power1_shiny/* {\n            reverse_proxy power1_shiny:3838\n    }\n    file_server\n}\n\nWe can accomplish what we need for items 4, 5, and 7 through the Caddyfile.\nNote:\n\nrgtlab.org is our domain name\nhandle_path maps all https requests to port 3838 where Shiny is listening.\n\nProviding our servers domain name, rgtlab.org is sufficient to initiate an exchange with the letsencrypt service to generates an SSL certificate.\nAnd a third file is the docker compose file that containerizes our Shiny app, pulls a caddy webserver image from Docker Hub and creates a local network for the two containers to communicate in.\n\na Docker-compose configuration file (default name docker-compose.yml).\n\nThe docker-compose.yml file:\n\ndocker-compose.yml. Show the code\nversion: \"3.7\"\n\nservices:\n  power1_shiny:\n    build: .\n    expose:\n    - \"3838\"\n  caddy:\n    image: caddy:2.3.0-alpine\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n      - \"443:443\"\n    volumes:\n      - $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile\n      - $PWD/site:/srv\n      - caddy_data:/data\nvolumes:\n    caddy_data:\n\nLastly, we need an html file, index.html that provides the landing page for our server.\n\nindex.html. Show the code\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Power1 app&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"./power1_shiny/\"&gt;Power1 app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt; \n\nAt this point our power1_app repo looks like this:\n.\n├── Caddyfile\n├── Dockerfile\n├── README.md\n├── docker-compose.yml\n├── power1_shiny\n│   └── app.R\n└── site\n    └── index.html"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Photo by Nathan Waters on Unsplash \n\nIntroduction\nNeovim (a fork of Vim) is a text editor that has several advantages for data science code development. One of the main attractions is that it is open source and has a number of useful plugins to facilitate working on R, python, and julia code. Also, its modal, keyboard-centric system allows text and code manipulation at potentially far greater speed than conventional, mouse-centric, systems.\nIn this post we describe both a minimal, yet functional setup, as well as a more extensive setup utilizing several of the newest neovim-only plugins, for neovim to allow IDE style code editing and REPL interaction for the three primary data science coding tools: R, Python, and Julia.\nOur presentation here is for a Macos environment. Appendix one contains required adjustments for a ubuntu linux environment.\n\n\nInstall the latest stable version of neovim.\nWith minimal effort we can install both the terminal and GUI versions of neovim. The simplist approach is to use homebrew:\n&gt; brew install neovim neovim-qt\nSet up convenience aliases in zsh.\n&gt; alias ng = neovim-qt\n&gt; alias nt = neovim\n(mnemonic: the t in nt is for terminal, the g in ng is for GUI)\n\n\nConfigure neovim\nThe standard location for neovim configuration files on “unix-like” systems is ~/.config/nvim. The main config file is either init.vim (VimL) or init.lua (Lua). In this post we’ll focus on lua based configuration.\nSpecifically, the following code block creates an nvim subdirectory under ~/.config and initialize a configuration file init.lua.\nHere is the file hierarchy we’ll construct. In fact all the code could be bundled into the init.lua file, but this approach is clearer and cleaner.\n.\n|-- ginit.vim\n|-- init.lua\n|-- lazy-lock.json\n|-- lua\n|   |-- basics.lua\n|   |-- leap-config.lua\n|   |-- nvim-R-config.lua\n|   |-- nvim-cmp-config.lua\n|   |-- nvim-telescope-config.lua\n|   |-- nvim-tree-config.lua\n|   `-- treesitter-config.lua\n|-- my_snippets\n|   |-- all.snippets\n|   |-- giles.tex.snipppets\n|   |-- mail.snippets\n|   |-- r.snippets\n|   |-- rmd.snippets\n|   |-- snippets.snippets\n|   |-- tex.snippets\n|   |-- text.snippets\n|   `-- txt.snippets\n|-- spell\n|   |-- en.utf-8.add\n|   `-- en.utf-8.add.spl\nTo install the lazy plugin manager\ngit clone https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git \\\n   ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/lazy.nvim\nAdd the following code to init.lua list the plugins needed to be installed from github and “feed” them to Lazy for installation.\nNvim-R, Leap, UltiSnips, and vimtex need additional configuration. The required code is contained in bespoke files under the lua directory.\n\nvim.g.mapleader = \" \"\nvim.g.maplocalleader =

(Detailed instructions for AWS EC2 were described in an earlier post: https://focusonr.org/posts/setupaws/)\nstep 0. Create an AWS account or sign in and navigate to the EC2 dashboard. step 1.

    "text": "3.2 Website\nTo configure the web server and containerize our app we need to add three files to the server, to go along with our Shiny app in the power1_app directory and move all files to the server.\nThe three configuation files are:\n\na Docker configuration file (default name Dockerfile)\n\n\n\n  Photo by Ian Taylor on Unsplash \nWe’ll use docker to access R/Shiny. Here is our minimal dockerfile:\n\nShow the code\nFROM rocker/shiny:4.2.0\nCOPY /power1_shiny/* /srv/shiny-server/\nCMD [\"/usr/bin/shiny-server\"]\n\nThis file instructs Docker to build a container based on a Rocker/Shiny image (which is a ubuntu image with R and Shiny installed) then copy into the container the power1_shiny directory containing the shiny code and finally launch Shiny server listening on (default) port 3838. We placed the power1_shiny/app.R code in the default location /srv/shiny-server so we only need to start the server and it will find the shiny program.\n\na Caddy web server configuration file (default name Caddyfile)\n\nWe’ll use Caddy as our web server. Caddy is an open-source tool that has the very useful feature of automating the acquiring and installing of an SSL certificate. (An SSL cert is required by most browsers to use the encrypted communication protocol https.)\nCaddy is configured with a file named Caddyfile. We use the caddy configuration file to specify three critical things.\n\nthe site domain name.\nthe authentication pair login/hash-password, for each user and\nthe ‘reverse proxy’ map that redirects requests to port 443 (ssl port) onto port 3838 (Shiny port) in the docker container.\n\nOur barebones Caddyfile looks like this:\n\nCaddyfile: Show the code\nrgtlab.org {\n    basicauth * /power1_shiny/* {\n        bob $2a$14$pYWd5O7JqNeGLS4m4CKkzemM2pq5ezn9bcTDowofZTl5wRVl8NTJm\n    }\n    root * /var/www/html\n    handle_path /power1_shiny/* {\n            reverse_proxy 0.0.0.0:3838\n    }\n    file_server\n}\n\nWe can accomplish what we need for items 4, 5, 6 and 7 through the Caddyfile.\nNote:\n\nrgtlab.org is our domain name\nthe basicauth directive specifies login credentials for bob (password: vanilla47)\nhandle_path maps all https requests to port 3838 where Shiny is listening.\nroot directive tells Caddy where to look for the index.html file.\n\nProviding our servers domain name, rgtlab.org is sufficient to initiate an exchange with the letsencrypt service to generates an SSL certificate.\nAnd the third file is the index.html file to provide a launch page for the app.\n\nindex.html: Show the code\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Power1 app</h1>\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"./power1_shiny/\">Power1 app</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html> \n\nOnce the three config files and the the Shiny code directory are in place copy the power1_app directory to the server rgtlab.org with the command:\nscp -i \"~/.ssh/power1_app_ssh.pem\" -r ~/prj/power1_app/  ubuntu@rgtlab.org:~\nLastly, ssh to the server and cd to power1_app directory\ncopy Caddyfile to location caddy expects in /etc/caddy directory\nsudo cp ./Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile \ncopy index.html to location caddy expects in /var/www/html directory\ncp  ./index.html /var/www/html/index.html \nand run the following command to\nbuild the Docker container on rgtlab.org\ndocker build -t power1_image .\ncreate container and run\ndocker run -d --name=power1_shiny -p 3838:3838 --restart=always power1_image\nrestart Caddy\nsudo systemctl reload caddy\nApp launch page is now available at https://rgtlab.org.\nand you’re good to go!"

    "section": "2.2 AWS Working Environment",
    "text": "2.2 AWS Working Environment\nAlong with selecting a server we’ll need to set up a working environment. We recommend setting up the working environment before launching the server, as it saves some back and forth. The working environment consists of four main components:\n\nA secure shell (ssh) key-pair to allow us to remotely and securely login to the virtual server once its launched.\nA firewall which will restrict server access to only secure connections. The firewall closes off all incoming traffic except through those ports specifically named.\n\nA static IP address. This is required for maintaining the link between the domain name and the server when rebooting. (The default is for the instance/server to be assigned a new IP address each time its rebooted).\n\nand 4. A domain name, say rgtlab.org. A domain name is not required but will facilitate collaborator access by not needing to use the IP address directly.\n\n2.2.1 Ssh key pair\nThe first time we create an AWS account we need to exchange an ssh key pair with AWS. The pairs consist of a private and a public key. The pair of keys will allow us to login securely to any server we launch on EC2. We can generate an ssh key pair in one of two ways in EC2. Either, locally, on our workstation and upload the public key to EC2, or have EC2 generate the key pair and download the private key.\nFor the first option we create a directory on our workstation to hold the keys and navigate to it. e.g. ~/.ssh. Generate the keys with the command\nssh-keygen -m PEM\n“PEM” defines the key format. More information on public key authentication can be found here. In the interactive dialog name the key prefix something like power1_app.pem. The dialog will ask for a passphrase. Enter one for an additional level of security, but its not required. The ssh-keygen program will generate two files: power1_app.pem.pub and power1_app.pub\nTo complete the process return to the EC2 dashboard select Actions and then Import key pairin the left panel. Enter the name power1_app and select the Browse button. Navigate to the file power1_app.pem.pub in the directory ~/.sshand and select the Import key pair button at the bottom of the page.\nFor the second approach select Create key pair botton in the upper right of the page.\nA form appears and asks for a name. Enter something like power1_app. Select RSA for key pair type and .pem for key file format.\nGive the pair a name, say power1_app, and the keys will be created and the private key power1_app.pem will be downloaded to our local machine to the ~/.ssh directory. Change the access permissions for the private key with the following command:\nsudo chmod 600 power1_app.pem\n\n\n2.2.2 Firewall\nTo create a firewall click on Network settings in the left hand panel. Choose Create security group and select Allow SSH traffic and Allow HTTPS traffic. This will create a firewall that leaves open only ports 22 and 443, for ssh and https incoming traffic respectively. The default name for the firewall will be something like launch-wizard-6. name the security group power1_firewall.\n\n\n2.2.3 Static IP address\nThe next step is to use the elastic IP service to get a static IP that can be assigned to the server. Navigate to Network and Security again and select Allocate Elastic IP. An IP will be assigned from the EC2 pool of available IPv4 IP addresses.\n\n\n2.2.4 Domain Name\nTo obtain a dedicated domain name go to Amazon route 53 to select a domain name and associate it with our static IP.\nOnce a domain name is acquired, e.g. rgtlab.org, associate it with our static IP address. This can be done via the Route 53 service. To associate domain name rgtlab.org with elastic IP do the following in Route 53:\n\nclick on hosted zones in side panel\nclick on rgtlab.org in center panel\nclick on checkbox for rgtlab.org type=A line\nthen click on edit record in right panel\nchange IP address to the static IP (e.g. 13.57.139.31)."
