We’ll create the configuration files we need on our workstation and push them github and from there they can be accessed from our server.\nThese three configuation files are:\n\na Docker configuration file (default name Dockerfile)\n\n\n\n  Photo by Ian Taylor on Unsplash \nWe’ll use docker to access R/Shiny, and docker-compose to access Caddy, our webserver. The first file is the dockerfile. Here is our minimal dockerfile with comments:\n\nshow the Dockerfile code\nfrom rocker/shiny:4.2.0\ncopy /power1_shiny/* /srv/shiny-server/\ncmd [\"/usr/bin/shiny-server\"]\n\n\nGrab the latest rocker/Shiny image from Docker Hub to use as a base image.\nCopy the Shiny code to the default location for shiny-server\nRun the Shiny-server using the default app code\n\nThis configuration file instructs Docker to build a container based on a Rocker/Shiny image (which itself is a ubuntu image with R and Shiny installed) then copy into the container the power1_shiny.R code and finally launch Shiny on (default) port 3838. We placed the power1_app.R code in the default location /srv/shiny-server we only need to start the server and it will find the shiny program.\n\na Caddy web server configuration file (default name Caddyfile)\n\nWe’ll use Caddy as our web server. Caddy is an open-source tool that has the very useful feature of automating the acquiring and installing of an SSL certificate. An SSL cert is required by most browsers to use the encrypted communication protocol https.\nCaddy is configured with a file named Caddyfile. We use the caddy configuration file to specify three critical things.\n\nthe site domain name.\nthe ‘reverse proxy’ map that redirects requests to port 443 (ssl port) to port 3838 (Shiny port).\nadd login credentials for bob/vanilla47:\n\nOur barebones Caddyfile looks like this:\n\nShow the Caddyfile code\n# use caddy auth tool to generate a password via the `bcrypt` algorithm. \n# &gt; caddy hash-password --plaintext vanilla47 \nrgtlab.org {\n    basicauth * /power1_shiny/* {\n        bob $2a$14$pYWd5O7JqNeGLS4m4CKkzemM2pq5ezn9bcTDowofZTl5wRVl8NTJm\n    }\n    root * /srv\n    handle_path /power1_shiny/* {\n            reverse_proxy power1_shiny:3838\n    }\n    file_server\n}\n\n```sh\n# use caddy auth tool to generate a password via the `bcrypt` algorithm. \n&gt; caddy hash-password --plaintext vanilla47 \ncaddy hash-password \nrgtlab.org {\nbasicauth * /power1_shiny/* {\n        bob $2a$14$pYWd5O7JqNeGLS4m4CKkzemM2pq5ezn9bcTDowofZTl5wRVl8NTJm\n    }\n    root * /var/www/html\n    handle_path /power1_shiny/* {\n            reverse_proxy 0.0.0.0:3838\n    }\n    file_server\n}\n\n\nWe can accomplish what we need for items 4, 5, and 7 through the\nCaddyfile.\n\nNote:\n\n-   rgtlab.org is our domain name\n-   `handle_path` maps all https requests to port 3838 where Shiny is\n    listening.\n\nProviding our servers domain name, `rgtlab.org` is sufficient to\ninitiate an exchange with the `letsencrypt` service to generates an SSL certificate.\n\nAnd a third file is the docker compose file that containerizes our\nShiny app, pulls a caddy webserver image from Docker Hub and creates a\nlocal network for the two containers to communicate in.\n\n3.   a Docker-compose configuration file (default name\n    `docker-compose.yml`).\n\nThe docker-compose.yml file:\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"`docker-compose.yml`. Show the code\"}\nversion: \"3.7\"\n\nservices:\n  power1_shiny:\n    build: .\n    expose:\n    - \"3838\"\n  caddy:\n    image: caddy:2.3.0-alpine\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n      - \"443:443\"\n    volumes:\n      - $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile\n      - $PWD/site:/srv\n      - caddy_data:/data\nvolumes:\n    caddy_data:\nLastly, we need an html file, index.html that provides the landing page for our server.\n\nindex.html. Show the code\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Power1 app&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"./power1_shiny/\"&gt;Power1 app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt; \n\nAt this point our power1_app repo looks like this:\n.\n├── Caddyfile\n├── Dockerfile\n├── README.md\n├── docker-compose.yml\n├── power1_shiny\n│   └── app.R\n└── site\n    └── index.html"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Photo by Nathan Waters on Unsplash \n\nIntroduction\nNeovim (a fork of Vim) is a text editor that has several advantages for data science code development. One of the main attractions is that it is open source and has a number of useful plugins to facilitate working on R, python, and julia code. Also, its modal, keyboard-centric system allows text and code manipulation at potentially far greater speed than conventional, mouse-centric, systems.\nIn this post we describe both a minimal, yet functional setup, as well as a more extensive setup utilizing several of the newest neovim-only plugins, for neovim to allow IDE style code editing and REPL interaction for the three primary data science coding tools: R, Python, and Julia.\nOur presentation here is for a Macos environment. Appendix one contains required adjustments for a ubuntu linux environment.\n\n\nInstall the latest stable version of neovim.\nWith minimal effort we can install both the terminal and GUI versions of neovim. The simplist approach is to use homebrew:\n&gt; brew install neovim neovim-qt\nSet up convenience aliases in zsh.\n&gt; alias ng = neovim-qt\n&gt; alias nt = neovim\n(mnemonic: the t in nt is for terminal, the g in ng is for GUI)\n\n\nConfigure neovim\nThe standard location for neovim configuration files on “unix-like” systems is ~/.config/nvim. The main config file is either init.vim (VimL) or init.lua (Lua). In this post we’ll focus on lua based configuration.\nSpecifically, the following code block creates an nvim subdirectory under ~/.config and initialize a configuration file init.lua.\nHere is the file hierarchy we’ll construct. In fact all the code could be bundled into the init.lua file, but this approach is clearer and cleaner.\n.\n|-- ginit.vim\n|-- init.lua\n|-- lazy-lock.json\n|-- lua\n|   |-- basics.lua\n|   |-- leap-config.lua\n|   |-- nvim-R-config.lua\n|   |-- nvim-cmp-config.lua\n|   |-- nvim-telescope-config.lua\n|   |-- nvim-tree-config.lua\n|   `-- treesitter-config.lua\n|-- my_snippets\n|   |-- all.snippets\n|   |-- giles.tex.snipppets\n|   |-- mail.snippets\n|   |-- r.snippets\n|   |-- rmd.snippets\n|   |-- snippets.snippets\n|   |-- tex.snippets\n|   |-- text.snippets\n|   `-- txt.snippets\n|-- spell\n|   |-- en.utf-8.add\n|   `-- en.utf-8.add.spl\nTo install the lazy plugin manager\ngit clone https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git \\\n   ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/lazy.nvim\nAdd the following code to init.lua list the plugins needed to be installed from github and “feed” them to Lazy for installation.\nNvim-R, Leap, UltiSnips, and vimtex need additional configuration. The required code is contained in bespoke files under the lua directory.\n\nvim.g.mapleader = \" \"\nvim.g.maplocalleader =
