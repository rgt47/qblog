@article{Salloway2021a,
abstract = {Dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD) causes predictable
	    biological changes decades before the onset of clinical symptoms,
	    enabling testing of interventions in the asymptomatic and
	    symptomatic stages to delay or slow disease progression. We
	    conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-arm trial of
	    gantenerumab or solanezumab in participants with DIAD across
	    asymptomatic and symptomatic disease stages. Mutation carriers were
	    assigned 3:1 to either drug or placebo and received treatment for
	    4–7 years. The primary outcome was a cognitive end point; secondary
	    outcomes included clinical, cognitive, imaging and fluid biomarker
	    measures. Fifty-two participants carrying a mutation were assigned
	    to receive gantenerumab, 52 solanezumab and 40 placebo. Both drugs
	    engaged their A$\beta$ targets but neither demonstrated a
	    beneficial effect on cognitive measures compared to controls. The
	    solanezumab-treated group showed a greater cognitive decline on
	    some measures and did not show benefits on downstream biomarkers.
	    Gantenerumab significantly reduced amyloid plaques, cerebrospinal
	    fluid total tau, and phospho-tau181 and attenuated increases of
	    neurofilament light chain. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities
	    edema was observed in 19.2% (3 out of 11 were mildly symptomatic)
	    of the gantenerumab group, 2.5% of the placebo group and 0% of the
	    solanezumab group. Gantenerumab and solanezumab did not slow
	    cognitive decline in symptomatic DIAD. The asymptomatic groups
	    showed no cognitive decline; symptomatic participants had declined
	    before reaching the target doses.},
