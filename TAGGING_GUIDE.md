## Tagging Best Practices

### How Many Tags to Use
- **Minimum**: 2-3 tags per post
- **Optimal**: 4-6 tags per post
- **Maximum**: 8-10 tags per post

### Tag Selection Strategy
1. **Primary method/tool** (1-2 tags): What's the main statistical method or R tool?
2. **Domain application** (1-2 tags): What field is this applied to?
3. **Technical level** (1-2 tags): Programming, statistical methods, etc.
4. **Emerging relevance** (0-2 tags): Any cutting-edge aspects?

### Examples

**Post: "Bayesian Analysis of Clinical Trial Data using R"**
```yaml
tags: [Bayesian Methods, Clinical Trials, R Programming, Medical Research, Statistical Computing]
```

**Post: "Building Interactive Dashboards for Healthcare Analytics"**
```yaml
tags: [Shiny, Healthcare Analytics, Data Visualization, R Programming, Medical Research]
```

**Post: "Machine Learning for Genomic Data Analysis"**
```yaml
tags: [Machine Learning, Genomics, R Programming, Biostatistics, Predictive Modeling]
```

## Color Coding System

For publication badges in the research section:
- `.badge-primary` (Red): Military/Defense topics
- `.badge-success` (Green): Medical/Clinical research
- `.badge-info` (Blue): Technical/Methods topics
- `.badge-warning` (Orange): Healthcare/Pandemic topics
- `.badge-secondary` (Gray): General research topics

## Maintenance

This tagging system should be reviewed annually and updated based on:
- Emerging trends in R/biostatistics community
- New research areas in the Thomas Lab
- Popular topics in data science blogging
- Community feedback and engagement metrics
