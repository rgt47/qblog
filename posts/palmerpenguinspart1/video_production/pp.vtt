Palmer Penguins Part One Exploratory Data Analysis and Simple Regression.

00:21.320 --> 00:26.520
Can we predict a penguin's body mass just from its flipper length?

00:26.520 --> 00:28.760
Let's find out.

00:28.760 --> 00:40.680
We have 333 penguins from three species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

00:40.680 --> 00:45.960
The scatter plot on the right already hints at something interesting.

00:45.960 --> 00:50.480
Longer flippers seem to go with heavier bodies.

00:50.480 --> 00:55.520
Gentoo penguins in blue are clearly the largest.

00:55.520 --> 01:01.760
But how strong is this relationship?

01:01.760 --> 01:09.360
The correlation between flipper length and body mass is 0.87—that's strong.

01:09.360 --> 01:14.000
But correlation only tells us variables are related to make predictions.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.480
We need regression.

01:15.480 --> 01:20.480
Let's fit a line through these points and see how well it works.
