ok! got my shiny app running. Works great! Now how do I get it up on the
web and shared with my client Bob?

Start by creating a repo for the app on github.

-   login to github (screenshot)

-   click on `new` . Then in `repository name` field enter `power1`.
    (Make the
-   repo private, we only want to share with Bob at this point).
-   create repo. Click `Create repository` green button at the bottom of
    the page.
-   back in a terminal window on your laptop: clone the repo

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/rgt47/power1.git
```

-   Create a Dockerfile to dockerize the shiny app.

The simplist Dockerfile grabs a pre-built image (say rocker/shiny) from
Dockerhub and copies the shiny app code (app.R) to the default location
on the docker image, and then runs shiny-server. Here's the file. Copy
it into the working directory and name it `Dockerfile`.

Here is our dockerfile:

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
FROM rocker/shiny:4.2.0
COPY app.R /srv/shiny-server/
USER shiny
CMD ["/usr/bin/shiny-server"]
```

-   Install Docker on your laptop. Instructions here:
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
-   Bulid and run the docker image to test it locally
    -   docker build -t app4 .
    -   docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 app4
-   copy `power1.R` and `Dockerfile` from working directory `app4` to
    the `power1` repo directory.

``` sh
cd ~/prj/app4/app.R ~/prj/app4/Dockerfile ~/prj/power1
```

-   from inside the `power1` directory, update remote repository
    -   git add .
    -   git commit -m 'add shiny code'
    -   git push
-   All good? Ok, now we need a (virtual) server to host the app. Let
    use Amazon AWS.
