# Introduction

This is the first in a series of posts offering suggested strategies for
leveraging open source technologies to provide straight-forward
solutions to one of the central challenges in the practice of data
science, i.e. how to effectively communicate analysis results to clients
and collaborators. The list of open-source technologies (software stack) we
suggest for employment is: linux, R, Shiny, Docker, Git, and Caddy. In
this post we'll make use of two cloud services Github and AWS. Further
posts will describe alternate constructions, e.g. using the low cost
cloud service: Hetzner.

Also described in other posts are strategies that avoid Github. This approach
provides a simpler initial construction, but a more labor intensive updating
process.  

This initial post provides a minimal, proof-of-concept example of how to
apply these technologies for hosting an interactive Shiny application.

In the following we start with a very simple, but hopefully still useful,
stand-alone Shiny app developed on our local workstation.   Then after some
straightforward interfacing with the Amazon web service environment, We  push
the Shiny app into the cloud, and end up with a secure (encrypted and
authenticated) app running on a website with a custom domain name. 

# Methods

To begin, lets assume we're just finished developing a new Shiny app,
named `power1_shiny` . (The methods described here apply generically to any
Shiny app, but we'll use one of our own for illustration). See the
`R/Shiny` code for our `power1_shiny` app (`power1.R`) [here](#appendix-1) in appendix 1.

We can test the app locally in your 
development directory by runnning it with the following command.

``` sh
R -e "library(shiny); runApp('power1_shiny.R', launch=T)"
```

This command will  run the R
program, load the Shiny package, and launch the app in your default browser.

Figure 2 below shows the Shiny app running locally in a browser, it consists of a widget to select the sample size and provide a dynamic
visualization (2D plot) of the power as a function of the standardized
effect size:

Once we determine our app is working as designed, the next step is to set up a
secure hosting environment on a virtual server By hosting the app on a (virtual)
server we simply need to send a link and security credentials to  our
collaborators. There are many ways to accomplish this. Here we'll demonstrate a
straightforward and efficient approach using mainstream cloud services and open
source tools. That is, we'll describe how to  'spin' up a server on Amazon Web
Service EC2 and in just a few steps, through the application of Docker, R,
Shiny, and Caddy (webserver) functionality we'll have a fully functional secure
web app to share with colleagues.

# Hosting

::: column-body
![*Data flow *](img/blogdockerizeflow.png)
:::

Figure 3 illustrates the tools we'll use and the flow of program and
configuration files. In order to host `power1` online we'll need to complete the
following tasks:

1.  create a virtual server (connected via ssh) with a firewall
2. obtain a static IP address (to identify the server online)
3.  obtain a domain name (name for IP address)
4.  install and configure a webserver (tool to interact with https protocol requests and
    respond)
5.  obtain and install an SSL certificate (to allow encrypted communication)
6.  setup an authentication method (password protection)
7.  configure a reverse proxy method (translate https (port 443) requests to Shiny
    (port 3838)

At first glance these 7 requirements can appear daunting, but on closer
inspection all can be met with relative ease and minimal  cost ( using a
cloud-hosting service, e.g. Amazon's EC2 or Digital Ocean, and a
"leased" domain name from, e.g. GoDaddy, or Amazon's Route 53)
or no cost( if you have your own  server with IP address, and domain name)

# Select a hosting service 

There are a number of cloud based server options: Microsoft Azure,
Oracle, Google Cloud, Amazon AWS EC2, Digital Ocean to name a few. Each
has their own approach to setting up a custom virtual server. Several
have free or low-cost service tiers available.

An overview of the process with EC2  follows. (Detailed
instructions for AWS EC2 are covered in the post "Setting up AWS server". )  

0. Create an account or sign in. 
1. Set up an interactive environment with AWS server.
    a. define ssh key-pair.
    b. configure firewall.
    c. request static IP.
    d. obtain domain name. 

Once the server is available connect via ssh and login, The only
necessary software to install is docker, docker-compose and git. Install
all 3 with the following command:

``` sh
sudo apt install -y git
sudo snap install docker.io
```

Once the host is set up and the requisite software installedh we'll have
a customized virtual server wtih a static IP address, and unique domain
name and firewall in place. In other words, items 1, 2, and 3 from our
list will be taken care of.


# Website

To configure the web server and containerize our app we need to add
three files to the repo, to go along with our Shiny app.

Its easiest to create files on the workstation and push then push the repo to github
 and from there we can access them from our server.

Details are in @appendix-1 Appendix 1. 

These three configuation files are:

1.   a Docker configuration file (default name `Dockerfile`)

::: column-body
![](img/docker1.jpg)
:::

</font>

We'll use docker to access  R/Shiny, and docker-compose to access Caddy, our webserver. The
first file is the dockerfile. Here is our minimal dockerfile with comments:

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

FROM rocker/shiny:4.2.0
COPY /power1_shiny/* /srv/shiny-server/
CMD ["/usr/bin/shiny-server"]
```

1. Grab the latest rocker/Shiny image from Docker Hub to use as a base image.
2.  Copy the Shiny code to the default location for shiny-server
3.  Run the Shiny-server using the default app code


This configuration file instructs Docker
to build a container based on a Rocker/Shiny image (which itself is a ubuntu
image with R and Shiny installed) then copy into the container the `power1_shiny.R` code and
finally launch Shiny on (default) port 3838. We placed the power1_app.R code in the
default location `/srv/shiny-server` we only need to start the server and it
will find the shiny program. 

2.   a Caddy web server configuration file (default name `Caddyfile`)

 We'll use `Caddy` as our web server. Caddy is an
open-source tool that has the very useful feature of automating the
acquiring and installing of an SSL certificate. An SSL cert is required
by most browsers to use the encrypted communication protocol https.

Caddy is configured with a file named `Caddyfile`. We use the caddy
configuration file to specify three critical things.

1.  the site domain name.
2.  the 'reverse proxy' map that redirects requests to port 443 (ssl
    port) to port 3838 (Shiny port).

Our barebones Caddyfile looks like this:

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
rgtlab.org {
    root * /srv
    handle_path /power1_shiny/* {
            reverse_proxy power1_shiny:3838
    }
    file_server
}

```

We can accomplish what we need for items 4, 5, 6 and 7 through the
Caddyfile.

Note:

-   rgtlab.org is our domain name
-   `handle_path` maps all https requests to port 3838 where Shiny is
    listening.

Providing our servers domain name, `rgtlab.org` is sufficient to
initiate an exchange with `letsencrypt` to generates an SSL certificate.

And the third file is the docker compose file that containerizes our
Shiny app, pulls a caddy webserver image from Docker Hub and creates a
local network for the two containers to communicate in.

3.   a Docker-compose configuration file (default name
    `docker-compose.yml`) (These are the default file names. If
    preferred, you can use custom names and point the program to the
    config file with command line options).

The docker-compose.yml file:

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"



version: "3.7"

services:
  power1_shiny:
    build: .
    expose:
    - "3838"
  caddy:
    image: caddy:2.3.0-alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - $PWD/site:/srv
      - caddy_data:/data
volumes:
    caddy_data:

```

# Github

Once in place on your laptop push the four files (power1_app.R, Dockerfile,
Caddyfile, docker-compose.yml) to github

``` sh
git push
```

and then ssh login to server and clone repo.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/joe47/power1_app.git
```

Lastly, cd to `power1` directory and run

``` sh
docker-compose up -d
```

and you're good to go!

The app `power1` can be accessed by 'bob' at the url

``` sh
https://power1.net/power1
```

with password 'thebunny'

# Appendix-1 {#appendix-1}

Consider an app that is a balance of simple and functional -- one that
calculates the power for a 2-sample t-test as a function of the
standardized effect size. re is our shiny app `power1.R`:

Consider the power1.R file:

``` sh

ui <- fluidPage(
titlePanel("Power Calculator for Two Group Parallel Designs"),
sliderInput("N", "Total Sample Size:", min = 0, max = 300, value = 100),
plotOutput("plot"),
verbatimTextOutput("eff"))

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  delta = seq(0, 1.5,.05)
  pow = reactive(sapply(delta, function(x) power.t.test(input$N, d=x)$power ))
  eff =  renderText(power.t.test(input$N, power=.8)$d)
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
  plot(delta, pow(), cex=1.5, ylab="power")
  abline(h = .8,  col = "red", lwd =2.5, lty = 4)
  abline(v = eff(), col = "blue",lwd =2.5, lty = 4)})  
  output$eff <- renderText(
    paste0("Std. effect detectable with power 80% = ", eff()) )
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

The app is designed to be maximally minimal. Using only base R
functions, with a minimum of reactive widgets and layout commands to
keep it simple while still performing a useful function.

# Appendix-4  {#appendix-4} Set up github repo

Start by creating a repo for the app on github.

-   login to github (screenshot)

::: column-body
![](img/git1.png)
:::

-   click on `new` . Then in `repository name` field enter `power1`.
    (Make the
-   repo private, we only want to share with Bob at this point).
-   create repo. Click `Create repository` green button at the bottom of
    the page.
-   back on your laptop: clone the repo:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/joe47/power1.git
```
then you can ssh into the new server with

``` sh
sh> ssh ec2
```

## Tip 2: Add ubuntu to the docker group to allow docker to run without sudo.

## Tip 3:

Copy file contents to workstation without using editor with shell
commands. \* Copy file from blog \* Issue the following shell command \*
paste the file contents \* type EOF on a new line.

``` sh
cat << EOF > Dockerfile
```





- install docker
`sudo snap install docker`
- clone github repo joe47/power1. Note: You'll need to authenticate to github. 
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/joe47/power1.git
```

- back on laptop...
- add `Caddyfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files to `power1` repo.
`Caddyfile`
```sh

power1app.org {
basicauth * {
		bob JDJhJDE0JElCQmRGaTA0ajY3bkZTLjRiWUZ4enVoZnVSQzVXVGVUMHlVcXJTaTRGYmpRQVFHLnYzN0tx
	}
	handle_path /power1/* {
		reverse_proxy power1:3838
	}
}
```

`docker-compose.yml`
```sh

version: "3.7"

services:
  power1:
    build: .
  caddy:
    image: caddy:2.3.0-alpine
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - caddy_data:/data
volumes:
    caddy_data:

```

- update (push to) github repo. 
``` sh
git add *
git commit -am "adding Caddyfile and docker-compose.yml"
git push
```
- back on server

Lastly, cd to `power1` directory and run

``` sh
git pull
docker-compose up -d
```
