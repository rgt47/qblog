Idea for setting up: 
1. ultisnips
2. text suggestions/completion
3. R, Rmd completion

What if all ultisnips are automatic. Maybe they could all start with zz or \?
And motion through stops could be with Tab and S-Tab

Right now text completion is  launched with S-Tab. That's a bit awkward

quarto-nvim plugin looks like a great idea. See if you can mimic the kickstarter
setup. 

start by copying ~/.config/nvim to ~/.config/nvim.mar25
next switch install from Paq to lazy
