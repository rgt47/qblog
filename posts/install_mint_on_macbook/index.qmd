# Introduction

## Install Mint onto a macbook pro 

The target MacBook is a 13-inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports. 

## Get an iso file from the Mint website

ISO file is 2.5 GB in size. 

Download torrent file from website [](https://www.linuxmint.com/torrents/linuxmint-21.1-cinnamon-64bit.iso.torrent)

Use app on macbook pro running macos, say `Transmission` to open torrent file and
download. Takes about 6 minutes via ethernet connection. 

Transfer iso file to USB drive, "burn". 
use Easy

Insert the USB flash drive into the target mac and reboot. 
Hold the ALT key to allow booting from the external USB drive. (The mac will
offer icons for the hard drive and the USB drive).  

From the Grub menu choose "Start Linux Mint 21.1 Cinnamon 64-bit"

There will be a long period with just the mint logo on the screen, maybe 5
minutes. (This is different from most other distro installs in our experience,
but is more consistent with an Apple or Windows install.)

Finally a linux mint desktop will appear. There is one icon on the screen
lfbeled "install Linux Mint". Double click it. 

A setup dialog will start. First Language, the Network, then codexes, the
options for a fresh install or something else. Next Location, then name a root
user and assign a password. 

Thats it. Reboot and login. 

Install the Broadcom drivers for Mint

sudo apt-get update 

sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source

The Linux Mint 21.1 Vera download site is [here](https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=302)

Could I use Docker?

This seems like genius:
```sh
alias nvim="docker run -it -v `pwd`:/mnt/volume --workdir=/mnt/volume anatolelucet/neovim:stable"
alias nvim="docker run -it -v `pwd`:/mnt/volume --workdir=/mnt/volume anatolelucet/neovim:nightly"

```


* step one set up parallels tools. Use "Actions" menu to select "install
 parallels tools. This will point CD/DVD device at the iso image. Open the DVD
in "Files". Open install parallel tool-gui. 

* macbook harddrive will be available under share
* Firefox is installed. Add vinium-ff extension.
