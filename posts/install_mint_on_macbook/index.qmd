# Introduction

## Install Mint on a macbook pro 

The target machine is a 2016 13-inch MacBook with four Thunderbolt 3 Ports. 

To start the process get an `iso` file from the Mint website. The current "Vera"
version of Mint `iso` file is 2.5 GB in size.
The  Vera download site is [here](https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=302).
 The download torrent file is  [here](https://www.linuxmint.com/torrents/).

On a macbook pro running `macos` you can use one of a number of apps to download the `iso` via torrent.  we
suggest `Transmission`. 

Once downloaded we can transfer  the ``iso`` file to a `USB` drive using one of
several methods.  On `Macos` we suggest using the app `balanaEtcher`. Download
`balanaEtcher` [here](https://etcher.balena.io/)

Insert the bootable `USB` flash drive into the target macbook and reboot.  Hold
the `ALT` key to allow booting from the external `USB` drive.  Select the icon
for the USB drive and a `grub` menu will appear.  From the `Grub` menu choose
`Start Linux Mint 21.1 Cinnamon 64-bit`.  and the Mint install program will
boot. 

A `linux mint` desktop will appear. There is one icon on the screen
labeled "install Linux Mint". Double click it. 

A setup dialog will start. 
Select in sequence

*	Language (English for us), 
*	then Network (suggest skip), 
*	then codexes (suggest skip), 
*	then options for a fresh install or "something else" (choose fresh to
*	devote full hard drive to Mint). 
*	next Location (Pacific region for us), 
*	then name a root user, a hostname,  and assign a password. 

Thats it. Reboot and login. 

At a minimum use Panda Wireless modem for internet access since Mint 21.1 has `Ralink RT5372` drivers installed. 
(see appendix for Broadcom install instructions) 

Add second monitor via `HDMI` or use Cinema display 27" via Thunderbolt adapter on older macbooks. 

Open Display menu. Select 2560x1440 as the resolution for both monitors. Monitor
scale at 150\%. 

Turn on Timeshift to provide hourly snapshots. 

Set keyboard and trackpad preferences: 

* Open `Mouse and Touchpad in settings. Turn on `Tap to click` and `Reverse scroll`. 

* Open `Keyboard` > `Layouts` > `Options` > `Caps Lock behavior` and select `Swap Esc and Caps-Lock`

Update base software. (NB upgrade may be an issue with 2013 macbook)
```sh
sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade
```

# Next steps...

Install basic utilities `git`, `wget`, `curl`, `zsh`, `vim`, `zathura`

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zsh wget curl git vim zathura -y
```

Install `oh-my-zsh`
and
`oh-my-zsh` plugins `z` and `z-autosuggestions`

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions \
   ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z \
   ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-z
```

Don't forget to edit `.zshrc` to include `z` and `z-autosuggestions` in the
plugins list. 

Install `Dropbox`, `Zotero` and `Texlive-full`. 
The easiest way to install `Dropbox`, `Zotero` and `Tex` is with the Mint software manager. 


Install qutebrowser and firefox. 
```sh
sudo apt install qutebrowser firefox;w

```
Add Vimium extension to firefox. 

Set up `Zotero` syncing.

for P in "${ff[@]}"
do
echo "create  a link for Dropbox/dotfiles version of $P in Home" 
    ln -v -s "$HOME/Dropbox/dotfiles/$P" "$HOME/$P"
done

dd=("sbx" "bin" "docs" "prj" "work" "shr")
for P in "${dd[@]}"
do
    echo "create  a link for Dropbox/dotfiles version of echo $P in Home" 
    ln -v -s "$HOME/Dropbox/$P" "$HOME/$P"
done
```
