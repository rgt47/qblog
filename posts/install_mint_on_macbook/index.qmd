# Introduction

## Install Mint on a macbook pro 

The target machine is a 2016 13-inch MacBook with four Thunderbolt 3 Ports. 

To start the process get an iso file from the Mint website. The ISO file is 2.5 GB in size.
The Linux Mint 21.1 Vera download site is [here](https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=302).
 The download torrent file is  [here](https://www.linuxmint.com/torrents/)

 on macbook pro running macos, Use an app to download the iso via torrent.  we
suggest `Transmission`, to open torrent file and download "iso". 

Next transfer ("burn") the `iso` file to a USB drive. 
On Macos we suggest using the app `balanaEtcher`. Download  `balanaEtcher` [here](https://etcher.balena.io/)

Insert the USB flash drive into the target mac and reboot. 
Hold the `ALT` key to allow booting from the external USB drive. 

From the `Grub` menu choose `Start Linux Mint 21.1 Cinnamon 64-bit`. 

A `linux mint` desktop will appear. There is one icon on the screen
labeled "install Linux Mint". Double click it. 

A setup dialog will start. 
In sequence
*	Language (English for us), 
*	then Network (suggest skip), 
*	then codexes (suggest skip), 
*	then options for a fresh install or "something else" (choose fresh to
*	devote full hard drive to Mint). 
*	next Location (Pacific region for us), 
*	then name a root user, a hostname,  and assign a password. 

Thats it. Reboot and login. 

At a minimum use Panda Wireless modem for internet access since Mint 21.1 has `Ralink RT5372` drivers installed. 
(see appendix for Broadcom install instructions) 

Add second monitor via HDMI or use Cinema display 27" via Thunderbolt adapter on older macbooks. 

Open Display menu. Select 2560x1440 for resolution for both monitors. Monitor
scale 150\%. 

Turn on Timeshift to provide hourly snapshots. 

Set keyboard and trackpad preferences: 

* Open `Mouse and Touchpad`. Turn on `Tap to click` and `Reverse scroll`. 

* Open `Keyboard` > `Layouts` > `Options` > `Caps Lock behavior` and select `Swap Esc and Caps-Lock`

Update base software. (upgrade may be an issue with 2012 macbook)
```sh
sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade
```

# Next steps...

Install basic utilities `git`, `wget`, `curl`, `zsh`, `vim`, `zathura`

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zsh wget curl git vim zathura -y
```

Install `oh-my-zsh`
and
Install oh-my-zsh plugins `z` and `z-autosuggestions`

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions \
   ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z \
   ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-z
```

Don't forget to edit `.zshrc` to include `z` and `z-autosuggestions` in the
plugins list. 

Install `Dropbox`, `Zotero` and `Texlive-full`. 
The easiest way to install `Dropbox`, `Zotero` and `Tex` is with the Mint software manager. 


Install qutebrowser and firefox. 
```sh
sudo apt install qutebrowser
```
Add Vimium extension

Set up `Zotero` syncing. 

# Install Ubuntu on Parallels

* step one set up parallels tools. Use "Actions" menu to select "install
 parallels tools. This will point CD/DVD device at the iso image. Open the DVD
in "Files". Open install parallel tool-gui. 

* macbook harddrive will be available under share
* Firefox is installed. Add vinium-ff extension. 

Idea:
Could I use Docker?

This seems like genius:
```sh
alias nvim="docker run -it -v `pwd`:/mnt/volume --workdir=/mnt/volume anatolelucet/neovim:stable"
alias nvim="docker run -it -v `pwd`:/mnt/volume --workdir=/mnt/volume anatolelucet/neovim:nightly"

```

## Script to set up links from local Home to Dropbox

`set_up_links.sh`

```sh
#!/bin/zsh
ff=(".zshrc" ".vimrc" ".local" ".vim" ".config")
for P in "${ff[@]}"
do
echo "create  a link for Dropbox/dotfiles version of $P in Home" 
    ln -v -s "$HOME/Dropbox/dotfiles/$P" "$HOME/$P"
done

dd=("sbx" "bin" "docs" "prj" "work" "shr")
for P in "${dd[@]}"
do
    echo "create  a link for Dropbox/dotfiles version of echo $P in Home" 
    ln -v -s "$HOME/Dropbox/$P" "$HOME/$P"
done
```
